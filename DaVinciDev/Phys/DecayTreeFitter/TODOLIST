Removing the constraint list.

Now that we use a reference, the whole idea of 'constraints' and
'mergedconstraints' is no longer needed. So, we can get rid of this
functionality again, which will clean up the code by quite a bit.

Furthermore, we'd like to find a way to add the chi2 contribution of a
constraint at the right place.

These are the steps

- make all 'project functions take a HepVector (or typedef of) rather
than a FitParams object. That makes more sense now that we have a
reference.

- implement 
   'virtual ErrCode ParticleBase::Filter( FitParams& fitparams,
                                          const ParamVector&reference)'
  this will replace 

     addToConstraintList
     projectConstraint(Constraint::Type type,
				      const FitParams& fitparams, 
				      Projection& p) const 

- we'd like to keep the projectConstraint functions as they are

PROPOSAL for changes to Particle

I don't know what is possible. I don't know what is helpful.

- VertexBase needs a 'FitStatus' flag

- ownership of the vertex. I cannot think of any reason why the particle doesn't just own the endVertex.

- can we store the decay length and the 8 additional entries to get the full covariance matrix

- can we rename the position-momentum covariance? the name is
  'posMomCovMatrix' while te actual things has momentum for the rows and
  position for the columns.

- ownership of daughters. How about the following. We add to Particle
a member m_mother. We then use the following rules for ownership of a duaghter 'reference':
 - if parent is set, the parent container holds ownership
 - if parent is not set and m_mother is set, the mother holds ownership. you'll run into trouble with cloning a decay tree.
 - if neither is set, somebody else hopefully has ownership

- can we use the RefCounter and RefCounted patterns?

- fast clone comparison. We add to particle a member 'uniqueId' which
follows the BtaUidHolder pattern. that allows to check for copies much
easier. To also test efficiently for clones, we need the whole
leaf-array thing which is not as nice.






LHCB

- why is the decay vertex stored separately in the event store. why not owned by the particle.

- protoparticle contains SmartRefs to daughters. that means daughters
need to be in a list. that means a vertex fit can never update
daughters.

- why does the Particle contain the vertex information and a reference
to an end vertex? I guess that this is not vertex info but actually a
begin point for tracks

- move mass constraint to particle base such that it is also accessible to BtaComposite

- remove merged moved constraints, constraint ordering

- implement sparce matrix for projection matrix (because that's what hurts most)

- re-compute energy when setting mass constraint (for better linearization)

- change order of constraints such that we get useful chisquare for each leave

- match to MC truth to test algo


---------------------


- revise RecoPhoton such that it can deal with Klongs --> no energy constraint

- think about what happens to bremstrahlung: e+ -> e+ gamma

- implement sparse matrices

- make a head-of-tree class, that derives from InternalParticle and is
  base for InteractionPoint.

- make charged particles curve (now only done for charged tracks) -->
not difficult: need only change ParticleBase::filterGeoConstraint.


[- move 'getFitted' from VtkVertex into ParticleBase]
[- move 'p4WErr'    from VtkVertex into ParticleBase (remove 'momIndex' from BeamSpot)]
[- move projection of kinematic constraint into daughter]

Things that need to be changed in VtxFitter:

- my fit fails if you try to vertex a pi0 without further constraints

- you cannot see if a bta-composite has seen a mass constraint or not;
this is a problem for the fit
